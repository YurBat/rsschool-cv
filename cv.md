### Summary 
My goal is to become a web developer because it is an interesting, creative, and perspective profession. I like it because web development looks like painting or cooking — there is nothing and suddenly you have the little masterpiece.

---

### Skills ###
I have strong knowledge of HTML, but I have intermediate knowledge of CSS and starter of JavaScript and Git.

I am not ashamed to ask for advice if I can't do my work well.
Also, I able to organize my work time and I always do right on time that work I have to do — without frustration or laziness.

But my strongest skill is interest in the profession and ability to quickly find and absorb information. I am learning new things from everywhere especially when I need it for me.

 I constantly read materials about web-development on some websites like www.habr.ru, www.css-live.ru, www.smashing-magazine.com, less often on www.css-tricks.com, www.web-standards.ru.
